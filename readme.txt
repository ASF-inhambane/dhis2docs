This is the DHIS2 documentation project. 

To build the documents, consult the DHIS2 documentation guide for details. 

Otherwise, just execute

mvn package

to build the documentation

If you want to build your own custom documentation, just modify the main pom.xml to suit your needs and then execute

mvn -f nameOfPom.xml package

where nameOfPom.xml is your custom pom.
