  <title>Using reporting functionality</title>
  <section>
    <title>Reporting functionality in DHIS 2</title>
    <para>The reporting module in DHIS 2 provides a range of reporting alternatives, and this section will explain how to use them to view and analyse data. Another section explains how to configure and set up the various reporting tools.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">The Dashboard:</emphasis> The fastest way to view your data. The dashboard can display  up to four updated charts as well as shortcuts to your favourite reports, report tables, and map views. Each user can configure a personal dashboard.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Charts:</emphasis> A quick way of viewing your indicator data in a line or bar chart. These are easy to set up and if you like can be dynamic and always show the most recent data for the logged in users orgunit. These charts can be viewed separately and printed, or included in a dashboard. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Report tables:</emphasis> These are very configurable table outputs of your data, either showing raw or aggregated data, as well as indicator data. These tables are used as either a data source for more advanced reports, for export to external systems, or as a crude report itself, and are exportable to pdf, excel, csv and jasper design files. These tables represent a  very dynamic, flexible and quick way to look at the data. Report tables can be set up with parameters to make them reusable over time and place.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Standard reports:</emphasis> Standard reports are built on report tables, but are more advanced in its design allowing for more cosmetics and styles. These reports can also combine multiple tables and charts in the same report and be made available as one-click reports that are very easy to use. These reports can be downloaded as .pdf files which makes them ideal for printing as well as sharing offline. Standard reports supports two different design files, either Jasper or BIRT. You can set which one to use in the system settings.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Dataset reports:</emphasis> Dataset reports are simply a printer friendly way to look at the data entry forms with either raw or aggregated data (over time or place). The design used in data entry will be used also in the data set reports. This will work only for data sets that has a custom data entry form set up.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Orgunit distribution reports:</emphasis> These reports are generated off the orgunit group set information and can show what types (and how many of each type) of health facilities that are located in a given area (any level in the hierarchy). These reports are automatically generated and display the information in both tables and charts, and downloads in pdf, excel, and csv are available.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Data completeness reports:</emphasis> These reports provide a nice overview of how many facilities that have submitted data for a given dataset and period. Here you can get both the counts and the percentages  showing how complete the data is. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Excel pivot tables:</emphasis> Excel pivot tables represents a very powerful way to analyse your data and DHIS 2 links directly to the pivot tables so that all the data will be available and updated in your Excel file. This can be a very useful tool for users that prefer working with the data offline. To update your local pivot tables you need a small pivot updater tool for DHIS that connects to the online server and downloads the latest data. This update will typically take place once a month when new data is available, but do not require a constant internet connection like the other reporting tools (if you are connecting to an online DHIS 2 server).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Web-based pivot tables:</emphasis> The built in pivot table tool is a simple web-based tool to display indicator data by orgunit and period in a typical pivot table view and allows for some basic pivoting manipulations of the tables. It is a quick and easy way to look at many indicator values at the same time (by orgunit and/or period), but does not have the same functionality as the offline Excel pivot tables. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">GIS:</emphasis> Present and analyse your data using thematic maps. You can view both data elements and indicators and given that you have coordinates for all your orgunits you can drill down the hierarchy and view maps for all levels from country polygons to facility points.  See the separate chapter on GIS for more details. All the map information is built into DHIS 2 and all you need to do is to register coordinates for your organisation units and the maps will be available.</para>

    <title>Using report tables</title>
    <para>Report tables are one of the more basic report options, but are fast and simple to use. To run a report table first navigate to the list of available report tables in Services-&gt;Reports-&gt;Report Tables and the click on the Green and white  arrow (the first symbol in the operations list) next to the report table you want to view. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Report parameters:</emphasis> Most report tables have parameters, which means that you can filter which orgunits and/or periods you want in the report. This makes the reports much more reusable. When you run the report table a Report parameter window will open and ask the user to input values for the selected parameters. The possible parameters are Reporting Month and Organisation Unit, and either one of these or both will show in the window.    After selecting the values click on the Get Report button.</para>

      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Export/view options:</emphasis> When the report table is ready it will be displayed in a html view. The report table can be exported to pdf (for better printing and easier saving), excel, csv, and also to a standard report format (Jasper) with a nicer table and a chart shown in pdf, or as  a jasper design file for further improvements and changes to the report design before uploading it as a standard report (see the Creating standard reports section).</para>

  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Using standard reports</title>
    <para>You access the available reports from the Services drop-down menu, by selecting Reports. In the report menu in the left bar, click Standard Report. A list of all pre-defined reports will appear in the main window. </para>

    </screenshot>
    <para>You run/view a report by clicking on the white and green arrow next to the report you want. You will then see a report parameter window where you must fill in the values needed for orgunit and/or reporting month, depending on what has been defined in the underlying report table(s). Click on &quot;Get Report&quot; when you are ready. The report will wither apper directly in your browser or be available as a .pdf file for download, depending on your browser settings for handling pdf files. You can save the file and keep it locally on your computer for later use. </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Using dataset reports</title>
    <para>Dataset reports are printer friendly views of the data entry screen filled with either raw or aggregated data. These are only available for data sets that have custom data entry forms and not for default or section forms.</para>
    <para>You can access data set reports from the Report menu under Services.</para>
    <para>A Criteria window will appear where you fill in the details for your report:</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Dataset:</emphasis> The data set you want to display.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Reporting period: </emphasis>The actual period you want data for. This can be aggregated as well as raw periods. This means that you can ask for a quarterly or annual report even though the data set is collected monthly. A data set&apos;s period type (collection frequency) is defined in data set maintenance. First select the period type (Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly etc.) in the drop down next to Prev and Next buttons, and then select one of the available periods from the dropdown list below. Use Prev and Next to jump one year back or forward.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Use data for selected unit only:</emphasis> Use this option if you want a report for an orgunit that has children, but only want the data collected directly for this unit and not the data collected by its children. If you want a typical aggregated report for an orgunit you do not want to tick this option.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Reporting Organisation unit:</emphasis> Here you select the orgunit you want the report for. This can be at any level in the hierarchy as the data will be aggregated up to this level automatically (if you do not tick the option above).</para>
    <para>When you are done filling in the report criteria you click on &quot;Generate&quot;. The report will appear in html view in a printer-friendly format. Use print and save as functions in the browser to print or save (as html) the report.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Using charts</title>
    <para>Charts are accessible in the Report menu under Services. You will see  a list of available charts that have already been created. Charts do not have parameters like the reports tables and standard reports, but can be set up with so called relative periods which makes them dynamic and reusable over time. Data will then be fetched from a period based on the current time of chart generation, e.g. a monthly report will contain data for the month of January if the chart is generated any time in the month of February.  The orgunit used in the chart can also be dynamic and then  follow the orgunit assigned to the current user running the chart.  Whether charts are dynamic in terms of period or orgunit depends on each chart&apos;s definition/configuration. See the section on setting up charts for more details.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Using the dashboard</title>
    <para>The dashboard is your first view into the data every time you log on to the system. Every user has its own dashboard, and a dashboard consists of 4 chart areas to the right and 3 short cut areas to the left.</para>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Customise shortcut areas:</emphasis> Each of the three short cut areas can hold a list of items from one of the following objects; Reports (standard), Documents, Data mart exports, Report tables, Map views, RSS Health. To add a new object type to a shortcut area click on the Insert link just above the area. Then to populate the list you need to add items one by one from the Services-&gt;Reports menus. From the various lists of reports, report tables, charts etc. you can add an item by clicking on the pie chart icon next to the item you want to add to the dashboard. </para>
    <para>E.g. to add your three favourite standard reports to the dashboard, first Insert Reports to one of the shortcut areas in the dashboard, then go to Services-&gt;Reports and click on Standard reports. From the list of standard reports you locate the reports you want and click on the pie chart icon next to each of the reports you want to add to the dashboard. When you go back to the dashboard you will see the three reports listed in the shortcut area where you inserted Reports.</para>
    <para>Use the Clear link above the shortcut area to empty an area. The Close link closes the insert menu without inserting a new object type.  </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Customise chart areas:</emphasis> There are four chart areas. To insert a chart simply click on insert and click on one of the charts in the list. Use Close to close the list without adding a new chart, and use Clear to empty a chart area. These charts will be updated every time you open the dashboard,  will automatically show data for the orgunit assigned to the current user, and will update the data when new periods are available. </para>

    <title>Using completeness reports</title>
    <para>Access the completeness report from the Services-&gt;Reports menu. Completeness reports will show how many datasets (forms) that have been submitted by orgunit and period. You an use one of three different methods to calculate completeness; 1) based on completeness button in data entry, 2) based on a set of defined compulsory data elements, or 3) based on the total registered data values for a dataset.  </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">To run the report do the following:</emphasis></para>
    <para>Select an orgunit from the tree.</para>
    <para>Select one of the completeness methods.</para>
    <para>Select all or one dataset (All will give you a report with all datasets for the seelcted orgunit. One dataset will give you a report with completeness for all the children of the selected orgunit.</para>
    <para>Select a period type and a period from the list of available periods for that period type. Move back/forward one year by using the Prev/Next buttons.</para>
    <para>Then the report will be shown automatically.</para>
    <para>Change any of the parameters above and the report will be updated automatically.</para>

    <title>Using orgunit distribution reports</title>
    <para>You can access the Orgunit Distribution reports from the left side menu in the Services-&gt;Reports module. </para>
    <para>Orgunit distribution reports are reports that show how the orgunits are distributed on various properties like type and ownership, and by geographical areas.</para>
    <para>The result can be presented in a table-based report or in a chart.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Running a report:</emphasis></para>
    <para>To run a report first select an orgunit in the upper left side orgunit tree. The report will be based on orgunits located under the selected orgunit. The select the orgunit group set that you want to use, typically these are Type, Ownership, Rural/Urban, but can be any user-defined orgunit group set. The you can click on either Get Report to get the table-based presentation or Get chart to get the same result in a chart.</para>
