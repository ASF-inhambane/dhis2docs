      <title>Data elements</title>
      <para>Data elements form the basis of DHIS2. Data elements define what is actually recorded in system, e.g. number of immunisations or number of cases of malaria. The actual creation and definition of the data elements themselves are far beyond the scope of this manual to describe, but it is assumed that an administrator will be provided with a list of standardised data elements for inclusion into the DHIS2 system. </para>
      <para>To access the data element maintenance module, choose Maintenance-&gt;Data elements-&gt;Data element. </para>
      <para>The ‘Filter by name’ will allow you to filter a range of data elements if you know either the full name of the data element, or just a part of it. Type the name
               into the search field and any matching data elements are displayed below.
               You can also choose ‘Filter by group/view all’ to narrow down a data
               element search within a particular data element group. In default mode, this
               field will display all the data elements in the application.
               The ‘Get PDF’ button can be clicked to generate a .pdf file of all the data
               elements. The &apos;Sort&apos; button can be used to sort the data elements into alphabetical order. </para>

    <section id="dataElementCategory">
      <title>Data element categories</title>
      <para>Data element categories can be used to disaggregate data elements into individual atomic components. Data element categories are typically a concept, such as Gender, Age or  Disease Status. Data elements such as &quot;Number of cases of confirmed malaria&quot; are often broken into smaller component parts to determine, for instance, the number of confirmed malaria cases of particular age groups. As an example, three data element categories: Under 1, 1-5 and Over 5 could be created. They could be assigned as categories to the data element, which would then create in the data entry screens, three separate fields for this data element namely: </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Number of confirmed malaria cases (Under 1)</para>

          <para>Number of confirmed malaria cases (Over 5)</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>Effective use of data element categories greatly simplifies the process of setting up the DHIS2 system, as the data element categories can be reused to disaggregate many different data elements. Otherwise, each of the data elements listed above, would need to be created separately. Judicious use of data element categories will greatly simplify the DHIS2 implementation, and allow for subsequent advanced analysis. </para>
      <para>Data element categories are composed of category options. Category options must be defined when a data element category is created for the first time. Subsequent changes to the data element category, i.e.  adding or deleting new category options, are not allowed once the data element category has been created. </para>

      <para> In this example, there would be two levels of disaggregation, consisting of two separate data element categories, each consisting of several data element category options. In most HMIS systems, different data elements are disaggregated according to a common set of categories. By combining these different categories into a data element category combination and assigning these combinations to data elements, the appropriate disaggregation levels can be applied efficiently and quickly to a large number of data elements. </para>
      <para>To access the data element category combination maintenance module, select &quot;Maintenance-&gt;Data element and indicators-&gt;Data element category combinations&quot; from the main DHIS2 menu. As with the  other maintains modules, you can filter the listed category combinations by entering the name (or portion thereof) of the category combination. Other operations such as &quot;Edit&quot;, &quot;Delete&quot; and &quot;Information&quot; should be familiar to the reader. </para>
      <para>To add a new category combination, click the &quot;Add new&quot; button. The following dialogue will be displayed. </para>

      <para>Type the name of the category combination in the &quot;Name&quot; field, and then select the desired categories from the left panel. Press the &quot;Move right&quot; button to add the selected categories to the category combination. Press &quot;Move left&quot; to remove any categories that should not be part of the category combination. </para>
      <caution>
        <para>Categories can only be added to a category combination at this step. Categories can be removed from category combinations later by editing the category combination, however, it is not allowed to add additional categories once the combination has been created. Ensure that the category combination and its respective categories is final before you create the category combination and assign it to a data element. </para>

      <para>Indicator types simply define a factor that will be applied during aggregation. Indicator values that are calculate during a data mart export or report table generation process will appear properly formatted, and will therefore not require an additional multiplier (e.g. 100 in the case of percents) for the values to appear correctly formatted. </para>
      <para>The indicator type maintenance panel has all of the same functions (Add new, Edit, Translate, Delete, and Information) as the Indicator maintenance section. </para>
      <para>There are only two fields that need to be filled-in to create an indicator type, Name and Factor, as seen below. Name refers to the Indicator type (e.g. Per cent, Per thousand, Per ten thousand, etc). The factor is the numeric factor that will be applied during the calculation of the indicator. </para>

    <title>Translations</title>
    <para>DHIS 2 provides functionality for translations of data element, data element group, indicator, indicator group, and data element category names.  These elements can be translated to any number of locales. A locale  represents a specific geographical, political, or cultural region. </para>
    <para>To add a translation click the Translate icon next to the element you would like to translate. Start by selecting the desired locale from the Locale select box. If your locale is not in the list you need to add it first. Fill in locale language and locale country code. The locale language is a lower-case, two-letter valid ISO Language Code. The locale country is a upper-case, two-letter valid ISO Country Code. Then in the Translate section, select your locale, then enter values for the avaliable element properties. You can select the reference locale, that is the locale the current element is displayed in, from the select box to the right.
