      <title>Overview of data quality check</title>
      <highlights>
        <para>Ensuring data quality is a key concern in building an effective HMIS. Data quality has different dimensions including:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Correctness:</emphasis> Data should be within the normal range for data collected at that facility. There should be no gross discrepancies when compared with data from related data elements.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Completeness:</emphasis> Data for all data elements for all health facilities/blocks/Taluka/districts should have been submitted.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Consistency:</emphasis> Data should be consistent with data entered during earlier months and years while allowing for changes with reorganization, increased work load, etc. and consistent with other similar facilities.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Timeliness:</emphasis> All data from all health facilities/blocks/Taluka/districts should be submitted at the appointed time.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </highlights>
      <para>If we have poor quality data, we will have “garbage in and garbage out” situations. Use of poor quality data leads to ill informed decisions. So, the HMIS software should be built in with different tools to do data quality checks and validation.</para>
      <sect3>
        <title>Data quality checks</title>
        <para>Data quality checking can be done through various means, including:</para>
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>At point of data entry, the software can check the data entered to see if it falls within the min-max ranges of that data element over the last six months or as defined by the user.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Defining various validation rules, which can be run once the user has finished data entry. The user can also check the entered data for a particular period and Organization Unit(s) against the validation rules, and display the violations for these validation rules. </para>

      <title>Data quality check at the point of data entry </title>
      <para>
 Data quality can be checked at the point of data entry through setting the minimum and maximum value range for each element manually or generating the min-max values using the DHIS 2 if there is historical data available for that data element.
    </para>
      <sect3>
        <title>Setting the minimum and maximum value range manually </title>
        <para>If you are using the default entry screen click on the element for which you want to set the min-max value, as shown below. </para>

        <para>On subsequent data entry if the value entered does not fall within the set min-max range the text box will change colour to red. The user will also get a pop-up as shown below. This change in colour is a prompt to check the data entered and make necessary correction.</para>

      <title>Defining Validation Rules </title>
      <para>Validation rules are data quality check mechanism based on verification of the logic of relation between related data elements. Validation rules are relational expressions comprising of related data elements and an operator that states the expected / logical relation between the elements. For example number of infant deaths cannot be greater than the number of deliveries. As can be seen from the example a validation rule comprises of a left and a right side. On the left side of the expression, there must be a data element or a combination of data elements, and the same on the right side. The left and right hand sides of the expression are separated with a validation operator which states the relation between the elements.  As validation rules have a relational property there must be at least two data elements for which the validation rules may be applied. </para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Enabling comparison across time (for example, previous
            months) and space (for example, across facilities and
            districts).</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>See trends (displaying data in time series to see their min
            and max levels).</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>
      <para>As a first step, DHIS 2 serves as a data collection, recording and
      compilation tool, and all data (be it in numbers or text form) can be
      entered into it. Data entry can be done in lists of data elements or in
      customized user defined forms based on the paper forms. </para>
      <para>As a next step, DHIS 2 can be used to increase data quality.
      Firstly, at the point of data entry, a check can be made to see if data
      falls within acceptable range levels of minimum and maximum values for
      any particular data element. Such checking, for example, can help to
      identify typing errors at the time of data entry. Further, user can
      define various validation rules, and DHIS 2 can run the data through the
      validation rules to identify violations.</para>
      <para>When data has been entered and verified, DHIS 2 can help to make
      different kinds of reports. The first kind are the routine reports that
      can be predefined, so that all those reports that need to be routine
      generated can be done on a click of a button. Further, DHIS 2 can help
      in the generation of analytical reports through comparisons of for
      example indicators across facilities or over time. Graphs, maps, reports
      and health profiles are amongst the outputs that DHIS 2 can produce, and
      these should routinely be produced, analyzed, and acted upon by health
      managers.</para>
