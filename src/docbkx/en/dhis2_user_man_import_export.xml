  <title>Import and export</title>
  <para>In a primary health system, the HMIS typically involves a distributed application, where the
    same application is running in different geographical locations (PHCs,CHCs, hospitals,
    districts, and state). Most of these physical locations do not have Internet connectivity, and
    hence they work offline. At some point (normally at the district level), the data needs to be
    synchronised in order to have a consolidated database for the a particular geographical region.
    For this, it is important to be able to export data from one location (which is working offline,
    say at the health facility level) to another one say at the district level where the data would
    need to be imported. This feature of exporting and importing is thus a crucial function of a
    HMIS. This feature also helps us overcome the dependency on Internet to some degree, as data
    updates can be transferred via USB key where there is no connectivity, or through email where
    there is limited Internet connectivity. DHIS 2 provides robust export-import functionality to
    fulfil these needs. </para>

    <title>Exporting data</title>
    <para>DHIS 2 makes it possible to export various types of data in multiple data formats. You can
      export your data, also referred to as measures or facts; and your meta-data, which refers to
      the information describing your data. Data can be exported both in raw, non-aggregated format
      and in aggregated format. It is also possible to export a combination of data and meta-data in
      case you have special requirements. This chapter covers mainly how to export data and
      meta-data through the user interface of the import-export DHIS 2 module. Data can also be
      exported programmatically through the DHIS 2 Web API, and it is useful to be aware of the
      various options available:</para>

    <para>Data can be exported on various formats, including DXF 2 (the DHIS 2 meta-data and data
      exchange format based on XML), CSV, PDF, MS Excel and the DHIS 1.4 XML format. </para>
    <para>Another aspect of data export is the type of DHIS 2 deployment. In the case of online
      deployment, all data is saved into a single database only. In an offline deployment, each
      instance will store data in a separate database in their local system. In an offline
      deployment, after the data entry is finished, data will have to be manually sent to the next
      level in the organizational hierarchy. In an on-line application this is not required, as all
      data is captured over an Internet connection and stored in a central location.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Exporting from DHIS 2</title>
      <para>The export option can be made use of by selecting it as follows. 
The import or export is available only when the selected organisation (source/destination) has defined datasets. This is because datasets help to define which data is to be or is being exported. Further, which specific data elements get exported is determined by the composition of the dataset being exported.
If there are no datasets defined for an organisation unit, it indicates that no data values are registered for this level of organisation or lower.
To access the main Import-Export module, choose <guimenu>Services-&gt;Import-Export</guimenu></para>
      <para>The exported data values are stored in an XML file. The file name is defined by the name
        of the source organisation unit and the period to allow the receiving organisation unit to
        identify the source and the period of the export file.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Exporting data to other DHIS 2 systems</title>
      <para>Once the data export screen is displayed, select the Organisation unit, period and dataset for which data export should be selected.Finally click on the export option that will be available on the lower left side of displayed screen.
If there are no datasets defined for an organisation unit, it indicates that no data values are registered for this level of organisation or lower.

      <section>
        <title>Metadata export</title>
        <para>Metadata is &quot;data about data&quot;. In the context of DHIS 2, metadata consists
          of definitions of data elements, indicators, the structure and names contained in the
          organizational hierarchy, and other options. Click on the &quot;Metadata export&quot; link
          from the main &quot;Data export&quot; screen in order to access this. Just select the
          features, format, and the compression that you want and click &quot;Export&quot;. This
          metadata file can then be transmitted just like a data file, except it will contain
          information on the definitions of the various features, as opposed to the values of the
          data themselves. </para>

    <title>Importing data</title>
    <para>The import option allows different instance of DHIS 2 to receive standardised set of data in the absence of a networked system. Typically, a data set is exported from one DHIS instance (e.g. a district level system) to another system (e.g. a provincial level system).  DHIS 2 is capable of importing data from other systems that either support the DXF of IXF formats. DHIS 2 is capable of importing data directly from a DHIS 1.4 Access database. Each of these options will be discussed in the following sections. </para>
    <section id="import_another_instance">
      <title>Importing data from another DHIS 2 instance</title>
      <para>Data can be imported into different instances of DHIS 2 through the use of the DXF data exchange format. There are two screens that are used to import data, with default and advanced options. </para>
      <para>The default data import menu can be accessed by clicking the <guimenuitem>&quot;Import&quot;</guimenuitem> from the main <guimenuitem>Import-Export</guimenuitem> screen. </para>
      <para>By clicking the <guibutton>&quot;Browse&quot;</guibutton> button, you can select a file from you local file system. This file may have been received by email, copied from another users system, or received on a CD for example. Simply select the file that you wish to import. </para>

      <para>There are three separate options for importing data. </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Dry run: This is similar to the old preview option, this will do a dry run import,
            and give you information about any errors.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Strategy: There are three options here, "New and Updates", "New only", and "Update
            only". New and updates tells the importer to expect both new metadata, and updates to
            existing ones. New only will only accept fresh metadata, usually you would use this on a
            empty database. Updates only will only allow the metadata to match metadata that is
            already there (same identifiers, new name etc).</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">NOTE: We highly recommend always using the Dry run
              option</emphasis> when importing data to make sure you keep control over any changes
            to your metadata and databases being out of synch on data elements or orgunit
            names.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Dry run before importing</title>
        <para>Before doing the import into your database, it is highly recommended that you run the
          import with the dry run option set to true first. This will enabled you to have a look at
          how many new, updates, and ignored metadata there will be. After you have selected your
          file, set dry run to true, you can now click the import button. After doing this, you will
          be greeted by this window.</para>

        <para>Here you can see that the organisation unit Nduvuibu MCHP had a unknown reference to
          an object with ID "aaaU6Kr7Gtpidn", which means that an object with this ID was not
          present in your imported file, and it could not be found in the existing database. Its
          important to note that even if a reference could not be found, the object will still be
          imported, but you might have to fix this directly in DHIS 2 later, if the reference should
          have pointed to something else.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Matching identifiers in DXF2</title>
      <para>The DXF2 format currently support matching for two identifiers, our own ID, and also a
        possible external identifier called code. When our importer is trying to search for
        references (like the one above), it will first go to the ID field, and then to the code
        field. This allows you to import from legacy systems without having a ID for every metadata
        object. I.e. if you are importing facility data from a legacy system, you can leave out the
        ID field completely (DHIS 2 will fill this in for you) and the put the legacy systems own
        identifiers in the code field, this identifier is required to be unique. This not only works
        for organisation units, but for all kinds of metadata, allowing for easy import from other
        systems.</para>

      <title>Importing data from DHIS 1.4</title>
      <para>There are two ways to import data from a DHIS 1.4 database; 1) through the 1.4 XML-based export files, or 2) directly from the DHIS 1.4 data file (.mdb). Both are accessible from the DHIS 1.4 Import menu under Import in the Import-Export module.</para>
      <para>It is critical that all data integrity violations which are present in the DHIS 1.4
        database be fully resolved before attempting an import into DHIS 2. You can check the data
        integrity of DHIS 1.4 through the CORE Module-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Data integrity checks. A
        report will be generated of all data integrity violations which should be resolved prior to
        importing into DHIS 2.</para>

        <title>DHIS 1.4 File (database) Import</title>
        <para>This method is recommend when doing large imports from 1.4, and especially when importing into a new  DHIS 2 database.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">DHIS 1.4 File Configuration</emphasis> </para>
        <para>Before you can start the 1.4 file import you need to provide a  few details about the 1.4 database:</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Import Type:</emphasis></para>
        <para>As with other imports you have the options to Import (directly), Preview, or Analyse the import. We recommend using the Analyse option first to check that the 1.4 database is OK and ready to be imported. </para>
        <para>When importing a large database into a new blank DHIS 2 database we recommend using the Import option to save time. </para>

        <para>If you want the full import, all the data in the 1.4 database you leave this field blank.</para>
        <para>If you only want to do an incremental import into an already existing DHIS 2 database you can use this field to filter which data values to import. Only values added or edited after the date you specify will be imported. This filter makes use of the LastUpdated column in the RoutineData table in the DHIS 1.4 data file.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Import process:</emphasis></para>
        <para>When you are done selecting Method, and LastUpdated you can begin the import by
          clicking on the Import button. This process might take a long time, depending on how many
          data values you are importing. On a reasonable spec. computer the import takes about 2
          million records per 30 minutes.</para>

        <para>Although it is possible to import and export data between instances of DHIS 1.4 and
          DHIS 2, there are significant limitations. Currently, the import of some metadata is not
          supported from DHIS 1.4 to DHIS 2. This includes:</para>
