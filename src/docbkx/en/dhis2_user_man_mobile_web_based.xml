  <title>Web based mobile solution</title>
  <para>The web based solution consists of two parts: Facility reporting, for data entry and
    reporting of regular
    DHIS2 aggregate data, and Activity reporting, for supporting individual activity reporting with the
    Community module.</para>

  <para>The solution relies on the mobile phone having a data connection available (i.e.
    GPRS,
    Edge, 3G), over which it communicates with a DHIS2 instance being publicly
    available on the
    internet, as any other web client. The application downloads the forms to be reported from the
    server,
    and the forms can therefore be updated without installing a new application. 
    </para>
  <section>
    <title>Data connection availability</title>
    <para>Data connection availability can be a problem in many of the contexts where DHIS2 mobile
      reporting would otherwise be a good solution
      for getting data directly into DHIS2. If that is
      the case for you, you might want to consider
      trying the SMS based solution for now.
      But keep
      in mind that even though a data connection is currently required for communication between
      the server and the mobile phone,
      it is only required when initializing or updating the mobile
      application and when sending reports
      to the server.
      The phone stores all entered data locally,
      so it it can work fine with only temporary access to a
      data connection on a regular basis.

    <title>Server side setup for facility reporting</title>
    <para>The server side component of the web based solution is no different than any other
      regular web application, and it is included in the regular build of DHIS2.</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <title>To try out the facility reporting, perform these steps on the
        server</title>
      <listitem>
        <para>For the data sets you want reported, set the "Available for mobile" flag
          on the edit dataset page.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Make sure the user that you want to log in as is associated to one (and
          only one) organizational unit has the "mobile" datasets assigned.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>That was all, go see if you can get the mobile working.</para>

  <section>
    <title>A little detail</title>
    <para>Though the previous steps is all that should be needed for testing the solution,
      there are of course some more things you want to know about the server setup.</para>
    <section>
      <title>The mapping of data sets to form layout on the phone</title>
      <para>By default a data set is mapped to one large form on the phone.
        If the data set is divided into sections, each section is a form page and
        If a data element has
        more than one category option combo it will be displayed as a heading with the combos
        following.</para>
