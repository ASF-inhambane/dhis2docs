  <title>Name-Based Information Tracking Module</title>
  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <section>
      <title>Quick Background</title>
      <para>The DHIS Community Module (also known as DHIS patient module or NBITS) is an integrated module in DHIS2 built to support community health systems and facilitate a smooth integration between the community health data and aggregated data management (e.g. HMIS)</para>
      <para>The module deals with person-level data as opposed to aggregated data which is the main focus of the core DHIS2 modules. The module supports management of community health programs such as: child immunization, maternal health and e.g. allows for tracking of individuals enrolled in various programs and activity planning for community health workers.</para>
      <para>This module is still under development and being piloted in India and Vietnam.</para>
      <para>While the user manual is still in progress we have collected bits of information related to the use of this module from various emails and discussion lists and put them all here to help you get started.</para>
      <para>Basically, it is similar to DHIS2, the following are the major things:</para>
      <para>1. Beneficiary</para>
      <para>2. Program</para>
      <para>3. Program Stage</para>
      <para>4. Data Entry</para>

      <title>Context and Concept</title>
      <para>Conventionally, Public Health Systems have been recording and reporting aggregated data of the services provided across various health programmes. Though this is crucial in monitoring &quot;reach&quot; and &quot;availability&quot; of public health services, but it lacks tracing the beneficiaries being provided these services and quality of service. For example, the aggregate report will show that 300 pregnant registered for ANC and 120 women given IFA tablets or 90 women given TT injection. In an aggregate system, it is not possible to ascertain that if a particular pregnant woman registered for ANC, has also been given IFA and TT, as data only shows aggregate numbers. To understand the quality of services given to each pregnant woman registered for ANC, immunization cycle of each child or treatment of each leprosy beneficiary, etc. it is important that treatment information of each beneficiary is maintained as an individual case.</para>

      <title>Objectives of Name Based Information Tracking</title>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Objectives of Name Based Information Tracking:</emphasis></para>
      <para>i. Track (follow-up) a beneficiary through the entire treatment period</para>
      <para>ii. Facilitate the service provider (health worker or doctor) in (beneficiary) patient�s treatment follow-up; by recording all treatment related information in one place (makes it comprehensive for the service-provider).</para>
      <para>iii. i. Help the beneficiary in recording treatment history in one place, which could be used later in case of referral.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Advantages of Name Based Information Tracking :</emphasis></para>
      <para>i. Facilitates in recording entire treatment information of each beneficiary (patient) </para>
      <para>ii. Facilitates health-workers in organizing out-reach</para>
      <para>iii. Facilitates service-provider in treatment follow-up</para>
      <para>iv. Facilitates in effective monitoring of different health services and drill down to individual beneficiary (patient) information.</para>
      <para>v. i. Helps strengthen the quality and fidelity of data</para>
      <para>Though at sub-center level the data in primary registers is recorded and maintained by individuals (name based), but is sent up-wards as aggregated reports. Now with HMIS reforms implemented and district on-wards data available on-line, the thrust has been on ensuring data quality implemented completeness. To-wards this one important initiative has been starting name based reporting - from sub-center to National level.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Registration</title>
        <para>The process of creating a new beneficiary in the system is through the registration process. The beneficiary is first registered in the system (or checked if beneficiary already exists in system). When a beneficiary is registered in the system, multiple identifiers can be associated with the registration. Passport number, PAN, driving license, health identifier, UID can be associated for the beneficiary. Internally, a location unique identifier is used to track the beneficiary.</para>
        <para>Searching a beneficiary can be done through identifiers, name, location or fingerprint. If the beneficiary already exists in the system, the encounter details can be opened and filled and the programme process can continue. If the beneficiary does not exist in the system, then new registration takes plac</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Identification of beneficiary and health worker</title>
        <para>The process of identification is location independent, this implies that irrespective of location where beneficiary registered for service the service/medical record can be searched and pulled-up in any other facility provided the same is in the database. For facilities which are not in the database, for eg a private facility, it will just be noted that &quot;service is provided at other facility&quot;. In such case, the beneficiary should be encouraged, to provide these details of services taken from other facility to the ANM. The health worker is first identified through any of the identifiers or username in the system and the beneficiary is identified through identifiers for receiving a health service. After identification, the beneficiary�s case history can be viewed or case can be updated with the new care that they have received.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Programme Enrollment and Treatment Plan</title>
        <para>When a beneficiary is enrolled into any health programme (ANC, Immunization etc) and a record of treatment is created for the beneficiary. Various services provided to the beneficiary through the treatment are recorded for the beneficiary and this, results in creation of a treatment plan for the beneficiary.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Case Encounters</title>
        <para>Each interaction with the beneficiary related to the case is considered to be an encounter and these encounters are recorded into the beneficiary case. Beneficiary case is updated with the identification of both the health worker and the beneficiary who is receiving the service.</para>

      <title>Modules in NBITS</title>
      <para>The NBITS application is an online application and developed as open source application. The application is platform independent and can be easily linked with other open source application. The application is developed on the similar DHIS framework and it has three basic modules as DHIS 2 namely - </para>
      <para>1. Maintenance  module</para>
      <para>2. Services module</para>
      <para>3. Help module</para>
      <para>The functionalities of these modules are same as DHIS 2. There will be some additions in the NBITS in both maintenance and services module. Maintenance module will have one additional sub module for the beneficiary registration and services module will have one additional sub module for name based data entry and recording.</para>

      <title>Processes of case tracking in NMITS</title>
      <para>The NBITS application is developed with the objective of tracking cases of any disease or condition by using this application. The process of tracking starts with the registration of cases in the application. Application can provide information for only those cases which are available in the data base, so the first process is the registration of beneficiary in the NBITS application. Once the beneficiary is registered she/he can be enrolled in the program for which registered. The application will guide the health provider for the services required by the beneficiary through activity plan and the services received by the beneficiary from time to time can be updated into his/her profile.  The working process of the application can be understood in steps depicted in picture below - </para>
      <para><graphic fileref="resources/images/patients_programs/Fig. 2.3.1.png" width="80%" align="center"/></para>
      <para>Figure 2.3.1</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">STEP 1: Beneficiary registration</emphasis></para>
      <para>The First step in the tracking is the registration of beneficiary/ case in the NBITS application. In the registration process the details related to the personal information, identification, contact and location details &amp; health provider details are entered in the application. In the registration itself beneficiary is provided with the unique identification number. This number will be unique and will not match with the identification number of any person in the state jurisdiction. The issue of identification number will be the responsibility of facility where the beneficiary is registered first time.</para>
      <para>Note - Any case irrespective of the program will be registered first and then will be enrolled in any of the program. E.g. every pregnant women and the child need to be registered first as a beneficiary than the beneficiary will be enrolled in mother or child care program.</para>
      <para>Beneficiary registration Process in application - </para>
      <para>A) To register a beneficiary in the application you have to go to the maintenance module and in the maintenance module select option ‘Beneficiary and Programs’</para>

      <para>D) Start process of registration by providing name, location details, identification details, contact details and health provider details.  To complete to process of registration click on Add button (arrow in RED color, fig. 2.3.6), given at the end of patient registration)</para>
      <para><graphic fileref="resources/images/patients_programs/Fig. 2.3.6.png" width="80%" align="center"/></para>
      <para>Figure 2.3.6</para>
      <para>To check the duplicates or to avoid double registration, after providing Name &amp; demographic details click on the Check duplicate button (arrow in BLUE color, fig. 2.3.6). Application will check from the existing records that whether same patient exists in the database or not. If the patient exists on the data base application will show that same patient exists in the database. Now user needs to cancel the registration process and update the records in existing patient data base. If the patient doesn’t exist in the database user can continue the process of registration.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">STEP 2 - Patient Enrolment- </emphasis></para>
      <para>After the patient registration patient needs to be enrolled in any of the program available in the application and for which s/he has been registered. To enroll -</para>
      <para>A) Click on the program enrolment icon </para>

</para>
      <para>C) After the selection of program you need to provide two dates-</para>
      <para>1. Date of Enrolment</para>
      <para>2. Date of Incidence</para>

      <para>Figure 2.3.9</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Date of enrollment</emphasis> is the date of registration of patient with facility (SC/PHC/CHC).
</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Date of incidence</emphasis> is the date of last menstrual period (LMP) in case of pregnant women and date of birth in case of child.</para>
      <para>D) Provide the dates and click on the enroll button to complete the enrollment process.</para>

      <para>Figure 2.3.10</para>
      <para>The application will automatically calculate the program stage dates and will show same below enrollment, if you want to reschedule any of visits you can do so by clicking on the calendar icon, selecting a date and later clicking on Update icon. These dates will be used to generate the activity plan/ visit plan form.</para>

      <para>Figure 2.3.11</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Note:</emphasis> - The date of incidence &amp; enrollment is very important to generate the activity plan for the Organization Units. Facility needs to ensure that they record &amp; report date of incidence with each case.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">STEP 3 – Updating the record at different stages of Program</emphasis></para>
      <para>As we know that in the health programs (i.e., mother care program: a pregnant women; or child program: a child) an individual (beneficiary) registered and enrolled into the system, needs to be checked from time to time by service providers.
The case updation in the NBITS application is designed in the same manner so that services received by the beneficiaries (i.e. pregnant women or child) can be updated from time to time as and when they visit the facility (SC, PHC, CHC) or  whenever they are visits by the health provider.</para>

      <para>What is program stage? - In the case of pregnant mother &amp; child tracking each case comes in the contact of health provider from time to time. There are some time bound services provided to them based on the stage of pregnancy or based on age of child. These different services at different period are defined as stages in the application. Whenever a case comes in the contact of the health provider and receives some services, these services then need to be updated into the patient record. </para>
      <para>After the selection of the program stage, provide the date of reporting to go to the case updation form and start the data entry.</para>

        <para>After finish to add new program stages for a program, it is necessary to “Sort” the program stages within the program.</para>
        <para>Based on the version of DHIS 2.0.5, sorting the stages is not yet supported automatically after first creating stages. In order to make sure the correct order, this step is very important for further functions, such as: data-entry for a beneficiary in a stage, summary report, visit plans, etc.</para>
