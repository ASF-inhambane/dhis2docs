  <title>Sharing</title>
  <para>This chapter discusses the sharing of entities feature in DHIS 2.</para>
  <section>
    <title>Sharing of objects</title>
    <para>A large part of the objects in DHIS 2, like reports, charts, maps and indicators, can be
      shared. Sharing means making an object, like a report, available for reading or modification
      to a group of users or to everyone. For instance for reports, the sharing dialog can be opened
      by clicking on the "Sharing settings" button next to each report in the list.</para>

    <para>You can share your report with everyone or with a number of user groups. Next to "Public
      access" you can choose your access option: "None", "Can view" or "Can edit and view". To share
      with a group, simply start typing the name of the group and the "Search for user groups" input
      field, and select your desired group. Click on the "+" icon next to the input field to share
      with that group. For each group you can set an access option, similar to public access.</para>
    <para>Sharing with a user group implies that all users in that group will get access to the
      shared object. To create a user group you can go to the dashboard module and click on "Groups"
      on the front page. This will lead you to the list of groups where you can click "Add new" in
      the top right corner. Creating user groups is open for everyone.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Sharing and access control</title>
    <para>Currently the objects which support sharing are indicator, indicator group, indicator
      group set, data dictionary, data set, program, user group, standard report, resource, report
      table, chart and map. </para>
    <para>In order to be able to create objects with public access (view or edit) your user account
      must have the authority to do so. All supported objects have a corresponding authority for
      creating public objects. As an example, to create a public accessible report your user must
      have the "Create public report" authority granted. The public access option will be disabled
      if not.</para>
    <para>To share an object with another person and let her edit the object will in most cases
      require that the person's user account has the authority for updating that type of objects
      granted. For instance, if you want to let another person edit your report, that person's user
      account must have the "Update report" authority granted. This does not apply for objects which
      are open for anyone to create, which currently are report table, map, chart and user
      group.</para>
    <para>When you create an object it will automatically become viewable for everyone if your user
      account has the authority to do so. As an example, if you create a report and you have the
      "Create public report" authority granted, the report will become viewable for everyone and
      editable for users with the "Update report" authority. If you do not have that authority
      granted the report will be private to yourself. After you have created an object, you can
      navigate to the sharing settings dialog and set your desired access options.</para>

    <title>Sharing applied</title>
    <para>The sharing functionality is useful in several scenarios. One use-case is setting up a
      DHIS instance for a global organisation with operations in multiple countries. Typically the
      organisation has a set of global data sets, indicators and reports which should apply to all
      countries, while all countries will have the need for country-specific data sets, indicators
      and reports. In this scenario the following approach could work: </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Set up one user group for global personell.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Set up a user group for personell in each country.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Create global data sets and reports, make them viewable for everyone and editable for
          the global user group only.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Create country-specific data sets and reports, make them viewable and editable for the
          country user group and the global user group only.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>This way, the global indicators and reports could be viewed and analysed by everyone, but
      maintained by the global user group only. The country-specific data sets, indicators and
      reports could be viewed and maintained by the country and global personell, without being
      visible or impacting the system for other countries in the organisation.</para>
    <para>A similar approach could work for a scenario with a donor, multiple funding agencies and
      implemeting partners in a country, where user groups could be set up for each of those
      entities.</para>
    <para>Another use-case is a country department of health with multiple health programs.
      Typically there is a need for having general reports and charts for the department while
      allowing the health programs to develop specific reports and charts for internal. This can be
      achieved by creating user groups for each health program. Later, when developing reports and
      charts, these can be made viewable and editable to the program user group only. This way the
      reports will not be visible to other programs and users. This is benecifial because the
      reports are kept internal to the program and because the visible list of reports of other
      users are kept shorter and more relevant.</para>
