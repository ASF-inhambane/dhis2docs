        <title>Background</title>
        <para>The Mydatamart tool was created to address a changing paradigm in the deployment of
            DHIS2. In the past, going back to the days even before DHIS was a web application, the
            typical data flows of the system, as installed in a district office, was between
            components which were closely located to one another. The DHIS application was used to
            provide a user interface to a database, which stored all the data and metadata for the
            application. In many settings the user interface, the application and the database might
            even be on the same computer. In other settings these three components might exist
            seperately on a small Local Area Network (LAN) within the district office.</para>
        <para>The user would interact with the database in two different ways. In the normal flow of
            working with DHIS2 she would work through the web interface and the DHIS2 web
            application would take care of updating the database in the background. When analyzing
            data, the typical approach is to create pivot tables using Microsoft Excel, and
            configure Excel to fetch the data required by configuring an ODBC connection which
            points to the database. These flows of data are illustrated in <xref
                linkend="dataflow_orig"/> below.</para>
        <figure id="dataflow_orig">
            <title>Data flows using DHIS2</title>
            <graphic align="center" width="4in"
                fileref="resources/images/mydatamart/dataflow_orig.png"/>
        </figure>
        <para>It is important to understand that the quantity of data being transported between the
            database and Excel pivot table (data flow 3 in the figure) can be quite large. By and
            large this is acceptable so long as the user is working on the same computer as the
            database or at least on the same high speed LAN. But the requirement for the user to be
            able to pull large amounts of data from the database in order to update pivot tables
            imposes a severe constraint on the possible DHIS2 deployment options. One of the
            benefits of a web application is that the application server does not need to be
            physically present in the district office. Having everything co-located creates an
            additional burden of hardware and software maintenance which distracts from the core
            function of the district office. Where the district office has reasonable internet
            connectivity it is preferable to be able to host the DHIS2 web application at some
            central location within a data centre where it can be professionally managed by system
            administrators with the requisite skills.</para>
        <para>The challenge that is introduced by this type of deployment is that we can no longer
            rely on users analyzing their data by performing frequent and voluminous updates of
            their pivot tables from the back end database. In fact, in a properly secured
            deployment, the district user will not be able to access the database at all. All
            interaction with DHIS2 would be through the web interface to the application.</para>
        <para>Mydatamart was created to address this problem. With Mydatamart, the data that is
            required to be analyzed in pivot tables is pulled incrementally from the dhis database
            via the dhis2 webserver and stored locally in a small but efficient local database. This
            database makes use of the widely deployed Sqlite database engine. This new dataflow is
            shown in red in <xref linkend="dataflow_new"/>.</para>
        <figure id="dataflow_new">
            <title>Using a local datamart</title>

                fileref="resources/images/mydatamart/dataflow_new.png"/>
        </figure>
        <para>With the data available locally, pivot tables in the district office can now be
            configured to use ODBC connections to the local Sqlite database instead of the remote
            database server.</para>

    <chapter>
        <title>Installation</title>
        <para>Installation of Mydatamart has been made as simple as possible. The application itself
            is a self-contained executable which doesn't require any additional installation
            procedure. If you have the executable then it is ready to run. If you are going to use
            Microsoft Excel to create and use pivot tables linked to your local datamart, then you
            do also need to install the Sqlite3 ODBC driver. In addition, power users might also
            want to make use of a database GUI application to inspect ot manipulate the datamart
            files directly. There are a number of freely available applications for viewing sqlite3
            databases - we highly recommend a program called sqlitestudio.</para>

        <title>The Mydatamart application</title>
        <para>The purpose of the Mydatamart application is to manage a local datamart store which is
            populated by downloading small chunks of data from the central DHIS2 web application. It
            also manages the details of ODBC connection parameters required to link Excel workbooks
            to your data.</para>
        <para>The simplest way to start mydatamart.exe is to double-click on the icon on your
            desktop. The application should open and show a window like <xref linkend="first"/>
            below:</para>
        <figure id="first">

            <graphic align="center" width="3in" fileref="resources/images/mydatamart/first.png"/>
        </figure>
        <para>All of the functionality of mydatamart is available through the menu items in the
            upper menu bar. Some of the more commonly used functions are also available through the
            image button bar immediately below the menu. If you hover your mouse slowly over these
            buttons a tooltip window should show the functions of each.</para>

            <section>
                <title>Creating a new datamart</title>
                <para>Now the main purpose of mydatamart is to manage your personal datamart files
                    so the first thing you will need to do is to create a new datamart. You can
                    create a new datamart either through the File->New menu option or by pressing
                    the button with the blue cross. When you create this new datamart you will be
                    prompted for a file name. The extension .dmart will be appended automatically to
                    the name. Give some thought to how and where you are going to store this file as
                    it will soon be full of valuable data so you really do need to look after it.
                    You can create a backup at any time by simply making a copy of this file, eg.
                    onto a USB memory stick.</para>
                <note>
                    <para>The .dmart file is actually an sqlite3 database file which you can also
                        open and view or edit with any sqlite3 capable tool, such as
                        sqlitestudio.</para>
                </note>
                <para>When you create the new datamart, the application will present a dialog like

                </figure>
                <para>The first thing you must do is to establish a connection with your dhis
                    server. To do this enter the full url (including http://) of the dhis server
                    into the box labelled <emphasis>URL</emphasis>. Then enter your online dhis user
                    name and password. Your password will not be saved anywhere on your machine. To
                    login press the button labelled <emphasis>Login</emphasis>. If the login was
                    successful you will be rewarded with a green tick icon next to the login
                    button.</para>

                <title>Populating the datamart with metadata</title>
                <para>The local datamart is designed to store aggregated data values from
                    dataelements and indicators in the online DHIS2 application. But before you can
                    do this, you must first populate the local datamart with
                        <emphasis>metadata</emphasis> from the remote dhis2.</para>
                <para>Metadata refers to the parts of the database which give the data values
                    meaning. This includes: <itemizedlist>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>Organisation units and hierarchy;</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>Dataelement and Indicator names;</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>Datavalue disaggregations (categories and categoryoptions);</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>Various groups and groupsets.</para>
                        </listitem>
                    </itemizedlist> This information is required to work with pivot tables and to
                    select important parameters relating to your organisation unit. </para>
                <para>Fortunately populating with metadata is a straightforward, if time consuming,
                    operation. The easiest way to load metadata from DHIS2 is to press the toolbar
                    button with the <inlinegraphic
                        fileref="resources/images/mydatamart/hierarchy.png" width="0.5cm"/> image.
                    It can also be done via the "Datamart->Load metadata from dhis" menu
                    option.</para>
                <para>The Mydatamart application will then contact the remote DHIS2 server and
                    download, transform and save the metadata into the local database.</para>
                <note>
                    <para>Currently the transform part of the operation is quite slow. Expect it to
                        take as long as ten minutes. During this time you cannot work with the
                        application so you have to be patient. The reason for the long time is that
                        it must process all of the orgunits in the dhis hierarchy, which for many
                        countries can be quite large. In future editions of Mydatamart we will
                        improve on this by cutting down the number of orgunits to be
                        processed.</para>
                </note>
                <para>Once the metadata download is complete the user will be returned to the
                    Settings interface where she can proceed to enter information about her
                    organisation unit and the level of analysis to be used. This configuration is
                    covered in the following section.</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Choosing Organisation unit and analysis level</title>
                <para>The benefit of using mydatamart is that you only need to download the data
                    from the dhis2 server which you need in your routine analysis. By selecting the
                    appropriate orgunit and level of analysis you ensure that your regular data
                    updates will be small and manageable even when bandwidth is limited.</para>
                <para>The two concepts to be aware of are your <emphasis>root orgunit</emphasis> and
                    your <emphasis>analysis level</emphasis>. To illustrate this using an example
                    from Kenya, let us assume you are based in the district office of Nyeri North in
                    Nyeri County. You have either been given pivot tables or you will make them to
                    analyze your data down to facility level. So you require data for all the
                    facilities within Nyeri North and you also require to see data for your peers
                    ie. the other districts within Nyeri County.</para>
                <para>Once you have created a new datamart and have downloaded metadata as described
                    in the previous section, you should be able to set these two parameters in the
                    settings dialog as illustrated below. If the dialog is not visible you can
                    access it by pressing the <inlinegraphic
                        fileref="resources/images/mydatamart/configuration.png" width="0.5cm"/>

                </figure>
                <para>Once you have set these once they will be saved with your datamart file.
                    Though they can be changed at any time or you might have different datamart
                    files with different settings. In most cases you will likely be maintaining a
                    single datamart file which you will have set up like the case of Nyeri North
                    above.</para>
                <note>
                    <para>You will have noticed from <xref linkend="analysis_level"/> that the
                        analysis level is converted to a number. So for example, in Kenya, the
                        facility is at level 5, the district is level 4 etc. These correspond to
                        orgunit hierarchy levels within dhis2. These numbers will vary from one
                        country implementation to another. For the most part you do not need to be
                        concerned with the number of the level, except when you come to selecting
                        views for analysis. Here you will see that the level number is used as part
                        of the naming convention for views.</para>

                <title>Downloading data</title>
                <para>Now that you have your local datamart set up you are ready to start populating
                    it with data from your online dhis2 server. Whereas you will probably only
                    adjust the settings when creating a new datamart, you will be doing regular
                    synching of your local datamart with the online server. If data is being
                    downloaded once a month, then the incremental size of each download will be
                    small. You can get to the data download screen either by pressing the
                        <inlinegraphic fileref="resources/images/mydatamart/data_mart_export.png"
                        width="0.5cm"/> button or by navigating to the "Datamart->Update Aggregate
                    Data" menu item.</para>
                <para><xref linkend="download"/>, shows the datamart update screen. You can set the
                    detailed options for your download here. There is not much to be done as the
                    defaults should match your typical operations.</para>

                <para>On the left hand side there are check boxes which you should set to indicate
                    whether you need data weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly (you can select more
                    than one). These are independently set for aggregated datavaues as well as
                    aggregated indicator values, though in most cases you will require the same
                    periodicity of databvalue and indicator value.</para>
                <para>On the right hand side you have the option to set the time period you are
                    downloading. The application will attempt to select a reasonable period for you.
                    Other than the very first time you download data, the default should be to
                    download the previous month's data.</para>
                <para>Below the period selection section are the two buttons which actually initiate
                    the download. The first button is used to download data for orgunits below the
                    root orgunit at the level which was specified previously. So in the example, it
                    will download aggregated data at the facility level (level 5) for facilities in
                    Nyere North.</para>
                <para>The second button is used to download aggregate data of our peers. In this
                    case it would ensure that we had data for all the districts in Nyere County.
                    This will allow the Nyere North user to analyze the data for all facilities in
                    Nyere North as well as to compare the performance of Nyere North district with
                    Nyere South district.</para>

                <title>Creating a new Excel workbook for analysis</title>
                <para>Pivot tables in Microsoft Excel are commonly used to analyze data in dhis2.
                    The mydatamart tool does not create pivot tables for you, but it does provide a
                    simple interface to get you started with an Excel workbook which is already
                    linked to views in your local datamart. This means that users do not need to
                    concern themselves with the technical detail of ODBC connection strings, DSNs or
                    what have you. This section describes how you get started with that. It does not
                    go into the detail of actually designing the pivot tables as this is described
                    elsewhere in the dhis2 user manual.</para>
                <para>The most important thing to have prepared when designing a pivot table are the
                    database views you will use. Mydatamart automatically creates some "standard"
                    views for dataelement values and indicator values for different periodicities -
                    weekly, monthly, quarterly, semesterly (every 6 months), yearly etc. Expert
                    users might also want to design additional custom views. Using a 3rd party tool
                    such as sqlstudio is useful for this. There is also an option to import an
                    arbitrary sql file into the database which can be used to share custom
                    views.</para>
                <para>To start the process of creating an Excel pivot table workbook, the user
                    should select "Reports->New Excel file" from the menu bar. She will immediately
                    be greeted with a dialog for selecting views such as illustrated in <xref
                        linkend="views"/> below.</para>
                <figure id="views">
                    <title>Selecting views</title>
                    <graphic align="center" width="3in"
                        fileref="resources/images/mydatamart/views.png"/>
                </figure>
                <para>Mydatamart will present a list of all defined views in the listbox on the
                    left. These include the automatically generated ones as well as any custom views
                    which may have been created outside of the tool. The names of the views give
                    some indication of their content. The auto generated views are named as
                    follows:</para>
                <para><code>pivotsource_&lt;datatype>_ou_&lt;level>_&lt;periodicity></code></para>
                <para>In <xref linkend="views"/> we can see that monthly and quarterly views for
                    indicators at level 4 (district) and 5 (facility) have been selected.
                    Double-clicking on a view in the left listbox causes the view to be selected for
                    inclusion. Similarly, double-clicking on a view in the right listbox causes the
                    view to be removed from the selection.</para>
                <note>
                    <para>A warning to power users creating custom views. You can name these views
                        whatever you like, but be sure not to use the name of one of the built in
                        views. If you do that your custom view will get overwritten when the
                        metadata is updated.</para>
                </note>
                <para>Once you have selected the required views you can click on "Create Excel
                    workbook". This will prompt you for a name and location for your new Excel
                    file.</para>

                <title>Working with your new Excel file</title>
                <para>When you create a new Excel file as described in the section above, Excel
                    should automatically open the new file. This file will have the database
                    connections to your selected views already populated. To see these connections
                    (on Excel 2007) first click on the "Data" menu, then select "Existing
                    Connections" from the toolbar. You should see something like <xref
                        linkend="existing_connections"/> below, showing the views that you selected
                    in the previous step.</para>

                </figure>
                <para>You can use these views to create pivot tables or simply to view the data
                    within a worksheet. To make use of a view simply double click on it. You will be
                    presented with a dialog similar to <xref linkend="pivotwizard"/>.</para>

                </note>
                <para>On completion of your pivot table design you can save it and/or copy it to a
                    new location. Whenever you have new data in your datamart you can refresh the
                    pivot tables. Refresh times should be reasonably fast as the data is coming from
                    your local datamart file.</para>
                <para>You can also share your pivot design with other mydatamart users, particularly
                    those at the same administrative level as yourself, as they will likely be
                    interested in the same views and analysis. To do this you should first ensure
                    that the Excel pivot cache is empty so that you are not trying to send enormous
                    files around by email (<emphasis>Instructions required on doing this -
                        Ed.</emphasis>).</para>
                <para>Remember that the database links in the Excel file are pointing at your
                    datamart file (the file with a .dmart extension which you create when starting a
                    new datamart). If you move that datamart file your connections will no longer
                    work. Similarly if you send the file to someone else, they will need to connect
                    the Excel file to their own datamart. This process is straightforward and is
                    described in the next section.</para>
