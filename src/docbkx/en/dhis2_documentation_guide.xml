    <title>DHIS 2 Documentation System Overview</title>
    <para remap="">DHIS 2 is a web-based aggregate information management system under
    very active development. While primarily intended for management of aggregate, georeferenced health data, it should be possible to use the system for other purposes as well. Currently, there are a large number of
    disconnected pockets of documentation in various formats (e.g.
    MediaWiki, Word documents, Confluence). There is a need to consolidate the
    documentation process and bring it more in-line with the distributed
    nature of the development of the application itself. It has been suggested
    therefore to move the current documentation to the DocBook platform. This
    article will not discuss the relative merits of the DocBook platform, but
    rather will serve as a brief guide to its use by DHIS 2 implementers,
    users and developers. Readers are encouraged to make their own decision
    about whether to use DocBook or not for documentation purposes.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>One of the main advantages of DocBook is that there is complete
    separation between the content and presentation. DocBook is a pure XML
    format, and is well documented. It is believed that only a very small
    subset of its features will be required in order to achieve much higher
    quality documentation for DHIS. There are some 400 separate mark-up
    elements that cater to almost any level of technical documentation needs,
    but in reality, only a few dozen of these element will probably need to be
    employed to achieve high-quality documentation for DHIS 2, both for
    printed as well as online formats such as HTML or integrated help systems
    within the application itself. Therefore, there are wide range of
    possibilities in terms of which editor can be used for the creation of
    DocBook files. A fairly complete list of possibilities is located <ulink url="http://wiki.docbook.org/topic/DocBookAuthoringTools">here</ulink>.  It is currently reccomended to use <ulink url="http://www.syntext.com/products/serna-free/ ">Syntext Serna Free</ulink> for authoring of DocBook source files with a WYSIWYG editor.  It is not reccomended to use the editor XXE Personal, as the editor &quot;silently&quot; places uneeded whitspace and other ornementation to the DocBook source which makes collaborative editing of documents very difficult. </para>
    <para>One of the key concepts to keep in mind when authoring documentation
    in DocBook, or other presentation neutral formats, is that the <emphasis role="bold">content </emphasis>of the document should be considered in the
    first instance. The <emphasis role="bold">presentation </emphasis>of the
    document will take place in a separate step, where it will be rendered
    into different formats, such as HTML and PDF. It is therefore important
    that the document is will organized  and structured, with appropriate
    DocBook tags and structural elements being considered.</para>
    <para>It is good practice to break your document in to various sections
    using the &quot;sect&quot;, or section element. Section elements can also be nested
    within each other, such as &quot;Section 1&quot; and &quot;Section 2&quot;. This concept is
    essentially the same as <productname>Microsoft Word</productname> or other word processing programs.
    DocBook will automatically take care of numbering the sections for you
    when the document is produced. Two other important elements are the
    &quot;itemizedlist&quot; and &quot;numberedlist&quot;. These are quite similar, but an
    itemized list corresponds to a bulleted list, which a numbered list will
    be rendered with each element being numbered sequentially. Other key
    elements are &quot;screenshot&quot; and &quot;table&quot; which should be
    self-explanatory.</para>

    <title>Getting started with Launchpad</title>
    <para>Currently, the documentation system is part of the source code
    housed at <ulink url="https://launchpad.net/">Launchpad</ulink>. Launchpad is a collaborative platform that enables multiple people to work on software projects collaboratively.  In order for this to be possible, a version control system is necessary in order to manage all the changes that multiple users may make. Launchpad uses the <emphasis>Bazaar</emphasis> source control system. While it is beyond the scope of this document to describe the functionality of <emphasis>Bazaar</emphasis>, users who wish to create documentation will need to gain at least a basic understanding of how the system works. A basic guide is provided in the next section. </para>
    <para> In order
    to start adding or editing the documentation, you should first perform a
    checkout of the source code. If you do not already have a Launchpad login
    id, you will need to get one. This can be done <ulink url="https://launchpad.net/+login">here</ulink>. Once you register with Launchpad, you will need to request access to
    the<emphasis> dhis2-documenters</emphasis> group. Login to Launchpad, and then request access
    <ulink url="https://code.launchpad.net/~dhis2-documenters/dhis2/dhis2-docbook-docs">here</ulink>.
    Your request will need to be approved by the group administrators. Once
    you have been granted access to the group, you can commit changes to the
    documentation branch and send and receive emails on the groups&apos; list. </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Getting the document source</title>
    <para>In order to edit the documentation, you will need to download the
    source pages of the documentation to your computer. Launchpad uses a
    version control system known as bzr . There are different methods for
    getting Bazaar working on your system, depending on which operating system
    you are using. A good step-by-step guide for <productname>Microsoft</productname> operating systems
    can be viewed <ulink url="http://wiki.showmedo.com/index.php/Using_Launchpad_and_Bazaar#Steps_to_download_a_project_on_Launchpad_that_uses_Bazaar_with_only_one_branch">here</ulink>.
    If you are using Linux, you will need to install bzr on your system
    through your package manager, or from source code.</para>
    <para>Once you have installed bzr on your system, you will need to
    download the document source. Just follow this procedure:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Make sure you have Bazaar installed.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Start Bazzar by right-clicking a folder if you are using <productname>Windows</productname>
        and selecting <command>Bzr Here</command>. If you use Linux, you can
        just create a folder to hold the document sources. You can place the
        document source in any folder you like.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>To download the latest revision of the DHIS2 documents project
        type: <command>bzr branch lp:~dhis2-documenters/dhis2/dhis2-docbook-docs</command> if you are using Linux, or alternatively if you are using <productname>Windows</productname> type the url to the source code repository &quot;<ulink url="https://www.launchpad.net/~dhis2-documenters/dhis2/dhis2-docbook-docs">https://www.launchpad.net/~dhis2-documenters/dhis2/dhis2-docbook-docs</ulink>&quot;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The download process should start and all the documentation
        source files will be downloaded to the folder that you
        specified.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Editing the documentation</title>
    <para>Once you have downloaded the source, you should have a series of
    folders inside of the dhis2-docbook-docs directory. All documents should
    be placed in the <filename>dhis2-docbook-docs/src/docbkx/XX</filename>
    folder. Note that the <filename>XX</filename> represents the ISO 639-1 (two-letter) language code of the documentation.  Place any image files that may be linked to your document in the
    <filename>/dhis2-docbook-docs/src/docbkx/XX/resources/images</filename> folder and link these
    inside your DocBook document using a relative file link. When the
    documentation is built, in a separate step, the images will be
    automatically copied over to the correct directory during the build
    process.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Handling multilingual documentation</title>
    <para>The directory structure of the documentation has been created in order to facilitate the creation of documents in any language. If you want to create a new set of documents in a given language, simply create a new directory in the <filename>dhis2-docbook-docs/src/docbkx/</filename> directory. Be sure to use the ISO 639-1 code for the language you are going to create documents in. A complete list of these codes can be found <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1">here</ulink>. Add a new folder for images in a sub-directory , replacing XX with the actual ISO 639-1 code for the language you will create documents in. You will also need to edit the pom.xml file in the main dhis2-docbook-docs directory. If you are unsure of what changes need to be made to this file, ask on the mailing list first, as this file controls the generation of all the documentation. </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Building the documentation</title>
    <para>In order to transform the documentation source files to different
    format, such as HTML or PDF, you will need to install the Apache Maven
    program. You can get a copy <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">here</ulink> or by installing
    it through your package manager if you are using Linux. A sample build
    file has been included as part of the documentation source. Just execute
    the command <command>build.bat</command> on Windows or
    <command>build.sh</command> on Linux from the
    <filename>/dhis2-docbook-docs </filename>directory. Maven will start to
    download the necessary components to transform the documents into HMTL and
    PDF. Once the process has completed (be patient the first time, as there
    are a number of components that must be downloaded), all of the target
    document types will be generated in the
    /<filename>dhis2-docbook-docs/target/docbkx</filename> directory. HTML
    documents will be in the HTML directory, and PDF documents will be in the
    PDF directory.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Committing your changes back to Launchpad</title>
    <para>Once you have finished editing your document, you will need to
    commit your changes back to Launchpad. Open up a command prompt on Windows
    or a shell on Linux, and navigate to the folder where you have placed your
    documentation. If you have added any new files or folders to your local branch, you
    will need to add them to the source tree with the <command>bzr add</command> command, followed by the folder or file name(s) that you have added . Once you have added all of your new files, you will
    need to commit them to your local branch with the following
    command:</para>
    <blockquote>
      <para><command>bzr commit -m &quot;Created Amharic translation of documentation&quot;</command></para>
    </blockquote>
    <para>Just add an informative message of what you have done. Once you have
    committed changes to your local branch, you can push them to the master
    branch with the following command: <blockquote>
        <para><command>bzr push lp:~dhis2-documenters/dhis2/dhis2-docbook-docs</command></para>
      </blockquote></para>
    <para>If you have any questions, or cannot find that you can get started, just send an email with your problem to <email>dhis2-documenters@lists.launchpad.net</email>.</para>
