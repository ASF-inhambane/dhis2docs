  <title>Using Pivot Table</title>
  <section>
    <title>Pivot Table overview</title>
    <para>The pivot table module enables users to create pivot tables, using all available data
        <emphasis role="italic">dimensions</emphasis> in DHIS 2. A pivot table is a dynamic tool for
      data analysis which lets you quickly summarize and arrange data according to its dimensions.
      Examples of data dimensions in DHIS 2 are data elements (explaining what the data means),
      periods (representing the time aspect) and the organisational hierarchy (representing the
      geographical location of the data). From these dimensions you can freely select dimension
        <emphasis role="italic">items</emphasis> to include in the pivot table.</para>
    <para>A pivot table can arrange data dimensions on <emphasis role="italic">columns</emphasis>,
        <emphasis role="italic">rows</emphasis>, and as <emphasis role="italic">filters</emphasis>.
      When you place a data dimension on columns, the pivot table will display one column per
      dimension item. If you place multiple data dimensions on colums, the pivot table will display
      one column for all combinations of the items in the selected dimensions. When you place a data
      dimension on rows, the pivot table will display one row per dimension item in a similar
      fashion. The dimensions you select as filters will not be included in the pivot table, but
      will aggregate and filter the table data based on the selected filter items.</para>
    <para>The workflow for creating a simple pivot table is:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Select dimension items in the left menu, for instance a few data elements.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Click "Layout" on the top menu and arrange the data dimensions as columns, rows, and
          filters. You can leave the selection as it is if desired.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Click "Update".</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>Based on the demo database, a pivot table approximately as below will be displayed. Notice
      how indicators are listed on columns and periods as rows.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Selecting dimension items</title>
    <para>The left menu will list sections for all available data dimensions. From each section you
      can select any number of dimension items. As an example, you can open the section for data
      elements and select any number of data elements from the available list. You can select an
      item by marking it and clicking on the arrow in the section header or simply double-clicking
      on the item. Before you can use a data dimension in your pivot table you must at least select
      on dimension item.</para>
    <para>For the <emphasis role="italic">indicator</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italic">data
        element</emphasis> dimensions you must first select one or all groups from the group list.
      You can then select data elements from the list of available items.</para>
    <para>For the <emphasis role="italic">period</emphasis> dimension you can choose between fixed
      and relative periods. An example of a fixed period is "January 2012". To select fixed periods
      start by selecting a period type from the period type list. You can then select periods from
      the list of available periods. Relative periods are periods relative to the current date.
      Examples of relative periods are "Last month" and "Last 5 years". Relative periods can be
      selected by ticking the checkboxes next to each relative period. The main advantage of using
      relative periods is that when you save a pivot table favorite, it will stay updated with the
      latest data as time goes by without the need for constantly updating it. The "Rewind one
      period" option will make the relative periods relative to the current date subtracted by one
      period. This is useful to manage situations where there is a gap between the end of the
      reporting period and the time when data is entered into the system.</para>
    <para>For the <emphasis role="italic">organisation unit</emphasis> dimension you can select any
      number of organisation units in the hierarchy. To select all organisation units below a
      specific organisation unit, right click and click "Select all children". To manually select
      multiple organisation units, click and hold the <emphasis role="italic">Ctrl</emphasis> button
      while clicking on organisation units. You can tick "User organisation unit" or "User
      organisation unit children" in order to dynamically insert the organisation unit or units
      associated with your user account. This is useful when you save a pivot table favorite and
      want to share it with other users, as the organisation units linked with the other user's
      account will be used when viewing the favorite.</para>

    <title>Arranging the table layout</title>
    <para>After selecting data dimensions it is time to arrange your pivot table. Click "Layout" in
      the top menu to open the layout screen. In this screen you can position your data dimensions
      as table columns, rows or filters by clicking and dragging the dimensions from the dimensions
      list to the respective column, row and filter lists. You can set any number of dimensions in
      any of the lists. For instance, you can click on "Organisation units" and drag it to the row
      list in order to position the organisation unit dimension as table rows. </para>
      <screenshot>
      <screeninfo>The table layout screen.</screeninfo>
      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata width="40%" fileref="resources/images/pivot_table/table_layout.png" format="PNG"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>
    <para>After you have set up your pivot table you can click "Update" to render it, or click
      "Hide" to hide the layout screen without any changes taking effect. Since we in our example
      have selected both the period and organisation unit dimensions as rows, the pivot table will
      generate all combinations of the items in these dimensions and produce a table like
      this:</para>

  <section>
    <title>Using table options</title>
    <para>Several table options are available when working with a pivot table. Open the options
      screen by clicking on "Options" in the top menu. The following options are available:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Show sub-totals: Display sub-totals in the table for each dimension. In the screenshot
          in the previous section, notice how subtotals are generated for each of the periods in the
          period dimension.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Hide empty rows: Hides empty rows from the table. This is useful when looking at large
          tables where a big part of the dimension items do not have data in order to keep the table
          more readable.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Display density: Controls the size of the cells in the table. Can be set to
          "comfortable", "normal" and "compact". The "compact" option is handy in order to fit large
          tables into the browser screen.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Font size: Controls the size of the table text font. Can be set to "large", "normal"
          and "small".</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Downloading data</title>
    <para>You can download the data in the current pivot table by clicking on "Download" in the top
      menu. The data can be downloaded in Microsoft Excel and CSV format. The downloaded data table
      will have one column per dimension. You can easily create a pivot table in Microsoft Excel
      from the the downloaded Excel file by clicking on "pivot table" in the top panel, then
      clicking on "create pivot table", marking the data range in the spreadsheet before clicking
      "OK".</para>
