  <title>Using reporting functionality</title>
  <section id="reporting_intro">
    <title>Reporting functionality in DHIS 2</title>
    <para>The reporting module in DHIS 2 provides a range of reporting alternatives, and this section will explain how to use them to view and analyse data. Another section explains how to configure and set up the various reporting tools.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Standard reports:</emphasis> Standard reports are built on report tables, but are more advanced in its design allowing for more cosmetics and styles. These reports can also combine multiple tables and charts in the same report and be made available as one-click reports that are very easy to use. These reports can be downloaded as PDF  files which makes them ideal for printing as well as sharing offline. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Dataset reports:</emphasis> Dataset reports are simply a printer friendly way to look at the data entry forms with either raw or aggregated data (over time or place). The design used in data entry will be used also in the data set reports. This will work only for data sets that has a custom data entry form set up.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Dashboard:</emphasis> The fastest way to view your data. The dashboard can display  up to four updated charts as well as shortcuts to your favourite reports, report tables, and map views. Each user can configure a personal dashboard.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Data Visualizer:</emphasis> Do flexible visualizations of your data as charts and data tables. Any numbe of indicators and data elements can be included. Several chart types are available, such as column, stacked column, line, area and pie charts. The charts can be saved in order to be easily retrieved later and can also be put on your personal dashboard. Charts can be downloaded as image and PDF files to your local computer. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Report tables:</emphasis> These are very configurable table outputs of your data, either showing raw or aggregated data, as well as indicator data. These tables are used as either a data source for more advanced reports, for export to external systems, or as a crude report itself, and are exportable to pdf, excel, csv and jasper design files. These tables represent a  very dynamic, flexible and quick way to look at the data. Report tables can be set up with parameters to make them reusable over time and place.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Orgunit distribution reports:</emphasis> These reports are generated off the orgunit group set information and can show what types (and how many of each type) of health facilities that are located in a given area (any level in the hierarchy). These reports are automatically generated and display the information in both tables and charts, and downloads in pdf, excel, and csv are available.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Reporting rate summary:</emphasis> These reports provide a nice overview of how many facilities that have submitted their data for a given dataset and period. Here you can get both the counts and the percentages  showing the reporting rate for all or single data sets.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Excel pivot tables:</emphasis> Excel pivot tables represents a very powerful way to analyse your data and DHIS 2 links directly to the pivot tables so that all the data will be available and updated in your Excel file. This can be a very useful tool for users that prefer working with the data offline. To update your local pivot tables you need the myDatamart tool which connects to the online server and downloads the latest data. This update will typically take place once a month when new data is available, but do not require a constant internet connection like the other reporting tools (if you are connecting to an online DHIS 2 server).</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Web-based pivot tables:</emphasis> The built in pivot table tool is a simple web-based tool to display indicator data by orgunit and period in a typical pivot table view and allows for some basic pivoting manipulations of the tables. It is a quick and easy way to look at many indicator values at the same time (by orgunit and/or period), but does not have the same functionality as the offline Excel pivot tables. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">GIS:</emphasis> Present and analyse your data using thematic maps. You can view both data elements and indicators and given that you have coordinates for all your orgunits you can drill down the hierarchy and view maps for all levels from country polygons to facility points.  See the separate chapter on GIS for more details. All the map information is built into DHIS 2 and all you need to do is to register coordinates for your organisation units and the maps will be available.</para>

  <section id="standard_reports">
    <title>Using standard reports</title>
    <para>You access the available reports from the Services drop-down menu, by selecting Reports. In the report menu in the left bar, click Standard Report. A list of all pre-defined reports will appear in the main window. </para>

    <para>You run/view a report by clicking on the white and green arrow next to the report you want. You will then see a report parameter window where you must fill in the values needed for orgunit and/or reporting month, depending on what has been defined in the underlying report table(s). Click on &quot;Get Report&quot; when you are ready. The report will wither apper directly in your browser or be available as a .pdf file for download, depending on your browser settings for handling pdf files. You can save the file and keep it locally on your computer for later use. </para>
  </section>
  <section id="report_tables">
    <title>Using report tables</title>
    <para>Report tables is a simple-to-use tool for creating tabular analysis. To run a report table first navigate to the list of available report tables in Services-&gt;Reports-&gt;Report Tables and the click on the Green and white  arrow (the first symbol in the operations list) next to the report table you want to view. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Report parameters:</emphasis> Most report tables have parameters, which means that you can filter which orgunits and/or periods you want in the report. This makes the reports much more reusable. When you run the report table a Report parameter window will open and ask the user to input values for the selected parameters. The possible parameters are Reporting Month and Organisation Unit, and either one of these or both will show in the window.    After selecting the values click on the Get Report button.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Export/view options:</emphasis> When the report table is ready it will be displayed in a html view. The report table can be exported to pdf (for better printing and easier saving), excel, csv, and also to a standard report format (Jasper) with a nicer table and a chart shown in pdf, or as  a jasper design file for further improvements and changes to the report design before uploading it as a standard report (see the Creating standard reports section).</para>

  </section>
  <section id="dataset_reports">
    <title>Using dataset reports</title>
    <para>Dataset reports are printer friendly views of the data entry screen filled with either raw or aggregated data. These are only available for data sets that have custom data entry forms and not for default or section forms.</para>
    <para>You can access data set reports from the Report menu under Services.</para>
    <para>A Criteria window will appear where you fill in the details for your report:</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Dataset:</emphasis> The data set you want to display.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Reporting period: </emphasis>The actual period you want data for. This can be aggregated as well as raw periods. This means that you can ask for a quarterly or annual report even though the data set is collected monthly. A data set&apos;s period type (collection frequency) is defined in data set maintenance. First select the period type (Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly etc.) in the drop down next to Prev and Next buttons, and then select one of the available periods from the dropdown list below. Use Prev and Next to jump one year back or forward.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Use data for selected unit only:</emphasis> Use this option if you want a report for an orgunit that has children, but only want the data collected directly for this unit and not the data collected by its children. If you want a typical aggregated report for an orgunit you do not want to tick this option.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Reporting Organisation unit:</emphasis> Here you select the orgunit you want the report for. This can be at any level in the hierarchy as the data will be aggregated up to this level automatically (if you do not tick the option above).</para>
    <para>When you are done filling in the report criteria you click on &quot;Generate&quot;. The report will appear in html view in a printer-friendly format. Use print and save as functions in the browser to print or save (as html) the report.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="resource">
    <title>Using resources</title>
    <para>The resource tool allows you to upload both files from your local computer to the DHIS server and to add links to other resources on the Internet through URLs. If you want to share the direct link to the DHIS resource you can right clik on the "view resource" button and copy the link address.</para>
    <para>The create a resource click on the &quot;Add new&quot; button. Enter a name for the resource, then choose between uploading a file or external URL. If you chose file upload click &quot;Choose file&quot; and select your file your local computer. If you chose URL enter the link to the resource on the Internet. Then click &quot;Save&quot;.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="data_visualizer">
    <title>Using data visualizer</title>
    <para>The data visualizer module can be accessed under &quot;Services&quot; in the top menu. See the chapter called &quot;Using data visualizer&quot; for a thorough explanation of this module.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="reporting_dashboard">
    <title>Using the dashboard</title>
    <para>The dashboard is your first view into the data every time you log on to the system. Every user has its own dashboard, and a dashboard consists of 4 chart areas to the right and 3 short cut areas to the left.</para>

      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Customise shortcut areas:</emphasis> Each of the three short cut areas can hold a list of items from one of the following objects; Reports (standard), Documents, Data mart exports, Report tables, Map views, RSS Health. To add a new object type to a shortcut area click on the Insert link just above the area. Then to populate the list you need to add items one by one from the Services-&gt;Reports menus. From the various lists of reports, report tables, charts etc. you can add an item by clicking on the pie chart icon next to the item you want to add to the dashboard. </para>
    <para>E.g. to add your three favourite standard reports to the dashboard, first Insert Reports to one of the shortcut areas in the dashboard, then go to Services-&gt;Reports and click on Standard reports. From the list of standard reports you locate the reports you want and click on the pie chart icon next to each of the reports you want to add to the dashboard. When you go back to the dashboard you will see the three reports listed in the shortcut area where you inserted Reports.</para>
    <para>Use the Clear link above the shortcut area to empty an area. The Close link closes the insert menu without inserting a new object type.  </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Customise chart areas:</emphasis> There are four chart areas. To insert a chart simply click on insert and click on one of the charts in the list. Use Close to close the list without adding a new chart, and use Clear to empty a chart area. These charts will be updated every time you open the dashboard,  will automatically show data for the orgunit assigned to the current user, and will update the data when new periods are available. </para>

  <section id="reporting_reporting_rate_summary">
    <title>Using reporting rate summary</title>
    <para>Access the reporting rate summary from the Services-&gt;Reports menu. Reporting rate summaries will show how many datasets (forms) that have been submitted by organisation unit and period. You an use one of three different methods to calculate completeness; 1) based on complete button in data entry, 2) based on a set of defined compulsory data elements, or 3) based on the total registered data values for a dataset.  </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">To run the report do the following:</emphasis></para>
    <para>Select an orgunit from the tree.</para>
    <para>Select one of the completeness methods.</para>
    <para>Select all or one dataset (All will give you a report with all datasets for the seelcted orgunit. One dataset will give you a report with completeness for all the children of the selected orgunit.</para>
    <para>Select a period type and a period from the list of available periods for that period type. Move back/forward one year by using the Prev/Next buttons.</para>
    <para>Then the report will be shown automatically.</para>
    <para>Change any of the parameters above and the report will be updated automatically.</para>

  <section id="orgunit_distribution_reports">
    <title>Using organisation unit distribution reports</title>
    <para>You can access the Orgunit Distribution reports from the left side menu in the Services-&gt;Reports module. </para>
    <para>Orgunit distribution reports are reports that show how the orgunits are distributed on various properties like type and ownership, and by geographical areas.</para>
    <para>The result can be presented in a table-based report or in a chart.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Running a report:</emphasis></para>
    <para>To run a report first select an orgunit in the upper left side orgunit tree. The report will be based on orgunits located under the selected orgunit. The select the orgunit group set that you want to use, typically these are Type, Ownership, Rural/Urban, but can be any user-defined orgunit group set. The you can click on either Get Report to get the table-based presentation or Get chart to get the same result in a chart.</para>

  <section id="web_pivot_table">
    <title>Using web pivot table</title>
    <para>The web pivot table is a tool for displaying and pivoting indicator and data element data in an easy way. From the open data selection box start by selecting data type which can be data elements or indicators. Select the a group as a filter or leave it on &quot;All&quot;. Select start date, end date and period type to indicate which periods you want to include in the pivot table. Continue by selecting an organisation unit from the selection tree. The childeren at the level below the selected organisationn unit will be included in the pivot table. Then click &quot;Get data&quot;.</para>
    <para>After loading a pivot table you will see that indicators (or data elements) will appear on top as columns, while periods and organiation units are combined as rows. If you want to pivot the table click on the &quot;Pivot&quot; button and select new dimensions. These dimensions will be displayed as columns in the table when clicking &quot;Pivot&quot;.</para>
    <para>In the pivot table you can click on any cell in order to show a menu. From this menu you can choose to visualize the relevant indicator, org unit and period as various chart variants.</para>
    <para>To save the pivot table data to your local computer click the &quot;Download as excel&quot; button. The Excel workbook will show each period as a sheet.</para>

  <section id="data_mart">
    <title>Using data mart management</title>
    <para>The data mart is a set of tables in the DHIS database which is used by all reporting and analysis tools to retrieve data from. The data mart is populated based on the collected data. This management user interface allows you to controll that process of converting collected data into aggregated data and write to the data mart.</para>
    <para>The data mart management screen allows you to select period types, start date and end date which will control which periods are included in the data mart process. By default all data elements, indicators and organisation units will be included.</para>
    <para>The data mart process might take a long time and heavily utilize the resources of your server so make sure you start such processes at a feasible time in production environments. Data mart processes can be scheduled as regular tasks in the data administration module.</para>
